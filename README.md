**Machine Learning Project Template**

**Overview:**
This repository provides a template for machine learning projects, structured to facilitate the training, evaluation, and deployment of machine learning models. The project includes various components, such as data ingestion, data transformation, model training, and utilities for saving and loading models.

This project template is inspired by a tutorial by Krish Naik, and includes my own enhancements and adaptations.

**Features**
Data Ingestion: Handles the process of loading and preparing raw data for analysis.
Data Transformation: Includes feature engineering, scaling, and encoding.
Model Training: Supports training multiple models and selecting the best one based on evaluation metrics.
Utilities: Functions for model persistence (saving and loading), model evaluation, and more.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.11 or higher
pip
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-project-template.git
cd machine-learning-project-template
Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Ingestion
Add your data files to the data/raw directory. The data ingestion script reads from this directory and processes the data accordingly.

Model Training
To train the models, run the following command:
python src/components/model_training.py
This script will train multiple models, evaluate them, and save the best model to the artifacts directory.

Modifications and Customization
Feel free to modify and customize the components as needed. For example, you can add new models, change the feature engineering steps, or adjust the evaluation metrics.
